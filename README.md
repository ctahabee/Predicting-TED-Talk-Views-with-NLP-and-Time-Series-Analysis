The results of this project would be useful to content contributors in understanding trends and patterns that identify drivers of popularity. The goal was to ultimately help creators design the best content and avoid pitfalls with regards to term frequency, language, sentiment, speech style, duration and a number of additional features. Based on the models, TED’s content contributors could increase their use of words that have a positive impact on either number of views or comments. With regards to the impact of term frequency, there were few patterns that emerged in the training data. More assertive words (like “don’t”) and specific terms that are possibly associated with more controversial topics like “God” and “Rich” tend to engage more comments from users. However, this claim would require further analysis, since it is difficult to accurately determine whether or not a word is assertive or controversial. In addition, Talks with longer duration (specifically longer than 10 minutes, as observed in the CART model with TF-IDF features generated from transcript and description) tend to have less views and comments. Furthermore, the pacing of speeches showed a significant association with views and comments - speeches with higher words per second tend to have a negative impact on views and comments. 

Ultimately, due to the high dimensionality, the prediction models did not perform too well on the test set. Open to suggestions on alternative approaches!
